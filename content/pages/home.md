          I've worked with FTS for over 10 years on numerous Microsoft Dynamics
          projects, ranging from solving small support issues up to full-cycle
          Dynamics implementations with complex requirements and
          mission-critical integrations. Unlike many outsourced development
          teams which can feel like a distant black box", FTS always felt like
          part of our in-house delivery team.

          Working with FTS has been a great experience for Restaurant365 and for
          me personally.  Ramsey and FTS have earned our full trust and respect
          through this partnership and we couldn’t be happier with the
          relationship and their performance. They provide quality work that is
          a great value for the price, and I fully recommend them to others.

          Foothill Solutions is hands down the best partner when you’re looking
          for new implementation services. Their ability to understand your
          issues and your needs is by far better than anyone I have worked with.
          They truly listen and will make the best recommendations for your
          solution. They understand the difference between configuration and
          customization which key to future upgrades. They always keep in mind
          that your software platform will be ever evolving, and programming
          done today must work with upgrades for tomorrow.
